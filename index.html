                  <strong>In this project,</strong> I attempted to redesign the
                  UI of the classic video game Mother 3. This game holds a
                  special place in the hearts of many, known for its compelling
                  narrative and memorable characters. I wanted to create a UI
                  that respected its roots while catering to today's gaming
                  expectations, breathing new life into this timeless gem.

               <p>
                  <strong>My journey started</strong> with a deep dive into the
                  original game's UI. Understanding its mechanics, player
                  interactions, and visual style was crucial. I gathered
                  insights from fellow gamers and community discussions,
                  understanding what elements resonated most and where
                  improvements could be made. Analyzing current gaming trends
                  and UI standards guided me in crafting a UI that felt both
                  familiar and fresh.

                  I feel that Mother 3 was a wonderfully quirky and iaginative
                  game, but he UI was as bland as bland gets. After studying the
                  old UI, I decided it was time to do some research on what
                  modern RPG's were doing with their UI.

               <p>
                  <strong>What affordances does the controller allow?</strong> Before designing, I decided to break down the nintendo switch controller into sections to figure out which buttons are even allowed. Because sure, if there are 8 actions a user can take, I could just systematically map each action to a different button. But due to common conventions, that would only frustrate users as they are forced re-learn how to play video games.

                     <p>
                       The two buttons that are most important are A and B, almost every action should be reached using these two. But at the same time, I do not want to drown users in sub-menus. so X an Y will help ease that burden from time to time. every other button will be basically be used for navigation.

                       I noticed that I was drawn to circular menus. This was a neat idea in skethes but was more cumbersome than expected later on. It ended up biting me in the rear during wireframing.

                  <strong>Putting the pieces together</strong> from my skethes make up the wire frame process. Notice that there are detailed views of the characters and background. I had resources available from <a src="https://mother3tribute.com/">mother3tribute.com</a> that I used in my design.

                     <br>
                        Oh boy, where to start. <br/> <br/>
                        I did have a fun time putting toghether different wireframe directions, but I found that my coveted circular menus were more  agregious that expected. <br/> <br/> Notice that I wanted to keep the rotating ticker numbers from the old games, as these are a staple of the mother/earthbound series. but these are square designs, that I somehow had to squish into a small circular/curved area 🤮.<br/> <br/>
                        I eventually mixed the rotated action items from slide 3 and the layout of slide 4 in my final product, but I had to remove the curves!

                        <br/> <br/>

                        Although, there were some good things to come out of this stage too. I figured out how I wanted characters to spin when selecting an action, letting the user know they are ready for their turn. I also figured out how to complete an action in only 2 or 3 button presses, which is nice if you are spamming A to get through an easy battle.

                     <p>
                        Take a moment to look through the slides. They are in order so you can imagine the flow of using an item or choosing an attack. 
                        <br/> <br/>
                        I decided to use a transparent, glassy menu, much like we saw in the Mario RPG study. I think it gives an element of "sci-fi" in this goofy world, as that is a big theme in the game
                        <br/> <br/>
                        Notice the square design throughout, except for the action choosing menu in battle. I wanted to keep this circular astethic agaist my better judgement because I thought is looked so cool, plus games like Mario Superstar Saga and persona 5 really inspired me to have some sort of interactive menu system for battle, This could use some tweaking still I think, but overall it looks good enough for now. 
                        <br/> <br/>
